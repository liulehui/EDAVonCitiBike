# EDAVonCitiBike
Edav on CitiBike data in NYC for Columbia 5702

This is a class project for STAT 5702 at Columbia University.

Our data is from [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/use-our-data/).

Our main analysis is based on the dataset of **June, 2018**.
For some time series analysis, we use the **samplefortimeseries.py** file to sample and combine datasets from historical data.

For Shiny app we bulit to do interactive data analysis, because of the 1 GB storage limitation at [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/), we use the **sampleforshiny.py** to extract variables we need for interactive display from the dataset of **June, 2018**.  

In addition, we also left join weather data from [NCDC](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov) to bind the weather information during the data analysis process.  

Please refer to our main analysis report ( **EDAVonCityBike.Rmd** or **EDAVonCityBike.html**.) for more detailed information.
