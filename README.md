Edav on CitiBike data in NYC for Columbia 5702

This is a class project for STAT 5702 at Columbia University.

Our data is from [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/use-our-data/).

Our main analysis is based on the dataset of June, 2018.
For some time series analysis, we use the samplefortimeseries.py file to sample and combine datasets from historical data.  
For Shiny app, because of the limitation of 1GB, we use the sampleforshiny.py to sample and extract small subset of June,2018.  
Other than that, we left join weather data from [NCDC] to get the weather information.  

Please refer to our main analysis report, which is EDAVonCityBike.Rmd and EDAVonCityBike.html.
